    <p>I decided to make a little challenge to the Pen or 
      Project creating members of CodePen:</p>
    <p class="emphasized">After you code a Pen or a Project, pick one part of 
      the code you can explain and write a post about it.</p>

    <p>Even though I've written a few, I understand how 
      intimidating it can be to get started on a long 
      tutorial-type blog post. If you just had to write 200 
      words explaining something small to someone else, what 
      would those words be?</p>

    <h2>Why write a Post?</h2>

    <p>You may have no aspirations of becoming a well known
      blogger, or the next author on CSS Tricks. A key skill
      of a Senior Designer or Developer is to be able to 
      adequately communicate their ideas via spoken and 
      written communication. Being able to write well about
      technical subjects will set you apart from your peers,
      whether you're looking for your first role, or your 
      sixth. The only way we can get better at writing is 
      with practice, so why not practice by explaining something
      you understand, because you made it - your CodePen creation!</p>

    <h2>Share your response to the challenge</h2>

    <p>If you've written a Post, share the link with me by 
      tweeting it to me at 
      <a href="https://twitter.com/rachsmithtweets">@rachsmithtweets</a> 
      or you can email it in to rach@codepen.io. I'll add it to the
      Posts list here and it will maybe (probably) end up in our Picked
      Posts on CodePen.</p>
